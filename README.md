Overview:

The OreStation module manages a fully server‑side ore‑processing station.
It handles:

Placing and removing ore models

Generating and storing ore fragments

Updating player data via DataManager

Displaying dynamic UI (SurfaceGuis + BillboardGui)

Leveling and upgrading the station

Touch‑based fragment collection

Object pooling for performance‑optimized UI elements

The system is modular, scalable, and designed for high‑performance tycoon‑style gameplay.


NOTE: The balancing between the Ore_StackAmount and the OreBulk (how many fragments you get per tick) needs to be redone.
